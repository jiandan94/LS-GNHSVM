# LS-GNHSVM
The R-code for solving our proposed LS-GNHSVM

`lsgnhsvm.R` is the main R code for sovling our proposed LS-GNHSVM method

`gaussian_kernel.R` and `poly_kernel.R` are the R codes for computing the Gaussian and Polynomial kernel transformations of two conformable matrices, which can be used for training nonlinear LS-GNHSVM.
